## Overview

This tool helps healthcare providers quickly calculate iron dosing for pediatric patients with RLS or restless sleep disorder who have low ferritin levels. It generates plain text output suitable for copy/paste into electronic health records (EHR) like EPIC.

## Features

- **Weight-based dosing** for children under 12 years (3 mg/kg/day, max 65 mg)
- **Fixed dosing** for adolescents 12+ years (65 mg)
- **Multiple preparation options**: liquids, chewables, and tablets
- **Dual language output**: English and Spanish versions with separate copy buttons
- **EHR-friendly**: Plain text format ready for EPIC or other EHRs

## Clinical Guidance

### Indications

- Consider treatment for ferritin 50-75 mcg/L

### Monitoring
- Recheck ferritin, TSAT, and TIBC in 2-3 months
- Target ferritin: 50-100 mcg/L

### Key Counseling Points
- Take in the morning on empty stomach
- Vitamin C enhances absorption (except for preparations that already contain it)
- Avoid dairy within 1-2 hours of iron dose
- May cause constipation (Miralax can help) and black stools (normal)
- Store safely out of reach of children
